# Object-Oriented-Programming
This repository contains projects developed as part of an advanced Java programming course. The projects cover various aspects and principles of Object Oriented Programming

**01 - Project Title: Object-Oriented Programming Shapes**

**Description:**
This project, implemented in the Smalltalk programming language, delves into Object-Oriented Programming principles through the creation of a hierarchy of geometric shapes. The foundational structure is provided by the abstract class `MyShape`, acting as the cornerstone for specific shape implementations.

**02 - Project Title: N-Queens Solver**

**Description:**

Welcome to the N-Queens Solver project implemented in Smalltalk! This solution is built around three key classes: `Board`, `Queen`, and `QueenTerminator`. Each class plays a crucial role in creating and solving the N-Queens puzzle.

**03 - Project Title: N-Queens Solver with Interactive GUI in Smalltalk**

**Description:**

Experience the N-Queens Solver project in Smalltalk, now featuring an engaging GUI for visualizing queen positions on the chessboard. The implementation revolves around three key classes: `Board`, `Queen`, and `QueenTerminator`. Explore the solutions interactively by customizing the number of queens, adjusting the simulation speed, and ensure that "QueenPiece.png" is located in the root directory (...\Contents\Resources).

**04 - Project Title: War Game Simulation**

**Description:**

Immerse yourself in the strategic world of the War Game Simulation, a Smalltalk project that allows 2 to 4 players to engage in an exciting card battle. The project is thoughtfully structured with classes like `WarPlayer`, `WarGame`, `PlayingTable`, `Card`, `Cards`, and `PlayingCards`, each playing a crucial role in creating a dynamic and interactive gaming experience.
